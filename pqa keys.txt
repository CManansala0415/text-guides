24hr 85%
16 psi 75%
water quality 97%

capex will slove the lacks of lsc

everymonth may report si branch for lsc,




Q1&2: How do you rate yourself when it comes to levels of service commitment (LSC), and what do you do when you don't achieve the LSC?
A1: As of July 31, 2023
Water availability - 85% (24/7)
Water pressure - 75% (@16psi + above 16psi)
Water quality - 97%
A2: When LSCs are not achieved - introduce CAPEX Projects

Q3: Who prepares the report card?
A3: The Branch Manager prepares the branch report card i.e., Comparative Monthly Report (CMR), reviewed by the Area Manager, forwarded to and consolidated by our Project Monitoring Associate and Executive Manager for preparation of the Operating and Financial Statistics (OFS), ultimately submitted to the President, VPOs and CFO
